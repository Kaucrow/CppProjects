# RatatuiExamples

This folder contains various programs made using the [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) rust crate.

The "hello_world", "counter_app", and "json_editor" programs were taken from the [ratatui tutorials webpage](https://ratatui.rs/tutorials/) with very few modifications.

## dither_wave demo
This effect was inspired by the "dither wave" effect that can sometimes be seen on the [world of horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Horror) indie videogame.
